# Futures-Visualization-Pipeline
A comprehensive set of techniques and tools to collect, process and visualize financial Futures data from scratch. The pipeline includes a special section on wrangling non-time indexed data (tick/range/volume charts). Such data are especially important since time-based charts exhibit undesirable statistical properties and over-sample low activity periods while under-sampling high activity periods (see Easley, Lopez de Prado, and Oâ€™Hara [2012]).
